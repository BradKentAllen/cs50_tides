Brad Allen tide server

<u>Introduction:</u>  I am not new to Python and have used FastAPI to run websites but I have not done it correctly and have wanted to set up a site after fully updating my approach.  CS50 seems like the perfect opportunity to do this.

I have also wanted to set up a small application that opens on my phone and gives me critical information on the tides at our house.  One desire is to have the output be somewhat artistic, as opposed to just text.  

Set up the server:

* RPi 4 model B
* 16 GB memory card
* power supply

RPi OS

<u>**Hardware**</u>
RPi 4 model B
64 GB memory card
username/password:
hostname:  homebase.local
username:  home
password:  goose



Steps

1. Put together hardware
   * set up RPi memory card
   * Set RPi to have a fixed IP address
2. Thought I needed NGINX, but did not because FastAPI works as web server
3. DuckDNS
